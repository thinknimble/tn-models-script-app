# TN-models debug script app

## Getting started

### Point to your preferred source of truth for `@thinknimble/tn-models`

Default is `latest`. But you can pick any version by changing package's json value for this key.
There's also the chance to debug side to side the library by pointing to a file, ig: If we have the tn-models-fp repo cloned and built we can point to its location by doing:

```
    "@thinknimble/tn-models": "file:../../models/main",
```

### Install

Just do:

```
pnpm install
```

### Run the app

Then you can start the script in watch mode with

```
pnpm start
```
